# Hopeflex E-commerce

This is a simple example of an e-commerce application using Node.js, Express, Supabase for the database and Stripe for payments.

## Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Stripe and Supabase credentials.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the store.

The `/admin` page provides a basic form to add products with price and stock.
